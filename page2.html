        <p>it's cold - often freezing in inland areas until February. Georgians warm up with Orthodox Christmas (7 January) and a week of festivities afterwards, and there's a lively winter sports scene, with several ski resorts to choose from. Well-established Gudauri, with the best infrastructure and skiable terrain, is 120km north of Tbilisi in the Great Caucasus; it has excellent powder, runs for all levels, good freeriding and even heliskiing. Bakuriani, in southern Georgia near Borjomi, is family-focused; and remote Svaneti in the northwest is a developing area growing in popularity, good for adventurous-minded ski travellers. Skiing in Georgia is very cheap compared to Western Europe and North America, crowds are few, and the vibe is refreshingly relaxed and informal.</p>
