        <p>With temperatures passing 30C in July and August, summer can get a little too hot for comfort in the capital, Tbilisi, and the rest of the lowlands that stretch along the middle of the country. So this is the perfect time to head to the coast or the mountains. Seawater temperatures at Batumi, the flashy main Black Sea resort, reach the upper 20s C in August. And with much of Tbilisi's nightlife migrating to Batumi during this period, the party atmosphere makes up for the stoniness of the beaches.</p>
