        <p>A good season: it's cooling down in the lowlands, and still warm enough to enjoy the mountains into October. Georgia has a LOT of trees, so the autumn colours are a delight. In a country where wine is a national passion, the grape harvest (late September to late October) is the focus of much feasting, music and merrymaking, especially in the main wine-making region, Kakheti (east of Tbilisi). Accommodation places in Kakheti (there are plenty, including some good winery hotels) can help you join in both the harvesting and the partying.</p>
