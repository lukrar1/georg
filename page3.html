        <p>There's many a spring shower, but it's not wet enough to spoil explorations of the lowlands and parts of the highlands, as the countryside blooms and temperatures reach the 20s C by May. Walking trails in foothill areas begin to open up, and the popular rafting season on the Aragvi rivers north of Tbilisi starts in late April. Georgian Easter happens now, too - up to five weeks after the Western one, with special services at Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta (near Tbilisi) and elsewhere.</p>
